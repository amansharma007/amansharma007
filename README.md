### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I push things to web.

I am a Frontend dev who loves coffee and gym as much as he loves to breath.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Vue.js, TailwindCSS.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about JavaScript.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with startups to build great things.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know `NaN !== NaN`? Shocking right? I was shocked too.
