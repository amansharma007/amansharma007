# Hi there <img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/b617c36f9db276d3146e974b8ff64f4c/tenor.gif" width="30px" height="30px" style="object-fit: contain !important;">, I push code to web.

I am a Frontend dev who loves coffee and gym as much as he loves to breath.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Vue.js, TailwindCSS.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m trying to get deeper into TypeScript and would normally love to have a chat around JavaScript.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with startups to build great things.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email on aman8696.56@gmail.com or on twitter [@nerdycap007](https://twitter.com/nerdycap007).
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know `NaN !== NaN`? Shocking, right?
